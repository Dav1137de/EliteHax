EliteHax - Hacker World: Official Repository by Dav1337de

I'm Dav1337de, developer of EliteHax. 
Well, I developed EliteHax, but I'm not a real developer. I have a good job in cybersecurity, but I learnt around 10-15 programming/scripting/misc languages at school and for hobby.
I basically decided to create EliteHax on December 2016 because I was tired of all the pay2win hacking games available at that time. I wanted to create a game without any p2w content, with great features and focused on the community. And I succeeded! It's incredible! 
During my first 30 years of life I tried 4 times to develop a game, but always abandoned for different reason, but EliteHax was released, and updated, and updated, and updated!
But life changes and suddenly you don't have time anymore to pursue an hobby that requires daily effort

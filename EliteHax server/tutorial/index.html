		<ul>
			<li>Internet: reduce the time needed to upgrade the other components;</li>
			<li>SIEM: increase the chance of detecting the IP Address of other hackers when they attack you, increase the chance of detecting Bot and RAT Malware that other hackers can implant on your network and increase the log capacity (1 more log every 250 SIEM levels, up to 30);</li>
			<li>Firewall: blocks other hackers from scanning you and see detailed information about your defenses; if your firewall is higher than the attacker scanner, the attacker won't be able to see all the information regarding your network;</li>
			<li>IPS: the IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) is able to detect and block the exploit-based attacks to your assets. The attacker will need higher Exploit Framework levels in order to bypass your IPS;</li>
			<li>Attacker Workstation: this button will bring you to the Attacker Machine Upgrade Screen, see the description below;</li>
			<li>C&C Server: increase the number of Bot and RAT Malwares that you can manage. Upgrade this component to be able to infect more victims with your malwares;</li>
			<li>Anonymizer: increase the chance of not being detected by your victims when you attack them. If they cannot see your IP Address they won't know who attacked them!</li>
			<li>Web Server: the first and most exposed of your assets; upgrade your Web Server to block higher Exploit attacks;</li>
			<li>Application Server: the middle layer of your infrastrucutre; upgrade your Application Server to block higher Exploit attacks;</li>

	<details>
	<summary>Attack Terminal</summary>
	<p>From the Attack Terminal you can scan your victims and attack them with different methods.</p>
	<p>The are different phases involved into an attack lifecycle: Reconnaissance, Scanning, Exploiting, Maintaining Persistence with Malwares, Covering Tracks.</p>
	
	<h4>Reconnaissance</h4>
	<p>The first phase, Reconnaissance, has the purpose of identifying the ideal target without engaging it.</p>
	<img src="terminal.PNG" alt="Attack Terminal" style="width:216px;">
	<p>In this phase you can choose your target based on its Firewall level and you can search for targets with a score similar to yours or with any score.</p>
	<p>Drag your finger from the Attacker Workstation to the hidden targets to see the firewall level of other hackers that have a similar score.
	<br/>The details of the targets that you already attacked are shown in red.
	<br/>
	<img src="already_attacked.PNG" alt="Attack Terminal" style="width:216px;">
	<br/>If you want to see other targets, just click on the Refresh button <img src="refresh.PNG" alt="Attack Terminal" style="width:20px;"> on the top right</p>
	<p>Alternatively, you can check the Global setting <img src="global.PNG" alt="Attack Terminal" style="width:60px;"> on the top left and search for any player, not only those with a similar score.</p>
	
	<h4>Scanning</h4>
	<p>When you find a good target, you can release the finger on its firewall to start the scan and see the stats of your victim.</p>
	<p>If you already know the IP Address of your victim, maybe because you received an attack and found the IP Address in the Attack Logs, you can insert the IP Address in the Manual Search input field and hit the Manual Search button. <img src="manual_scan.PNG" alt="Attack Terminal" style="width:216px;"></p>
	<p>You can also save frequently attacked targets in your Target List. Click the Target List button to open it.
	<br/>From the Target List, next to each target, you have three buttons to Edit the target details (Name and Comment), remove the target from the list or directly scan the target.
	<br/>
	<img src="target_list.PNG" alt="Target List" style="width:216px;">
	<br/>You can add up to 10 targets to the list by clicking on the Add Target button
	<br/>
	<img src="add_target_list.PNG" alt="Add Target List" style="width:216px;">
	<br/>Insert the Name of the Target, it's IP Address and optionally a comment such as its Crew or why you hack him (money, reputation, etc.).</p>
	
	<p>When the scan is complete, you can see the details of your victim based on your Scanner level and its Firewall level and the scanned firewall is marked with a darker green.
	<br/>
	<img src="scan.PNG" alt="Scan" style="width:216px;">
	<br/>If you see a '?' instead of the stat, it means that your scanner is not higher enough to discover that information.</p>
	<p>The victim is not aware that you are scanning him.</p>
	
	<h4>Exploiting</h4>
	<p>If you feel confident and you want to attack your victim, after scanning him you can tap on one of the Exploit options (on the left of the target firewall).</p>
	<img src="exploit.PNG" alt="Exploit" style="width:216px;">
	<p>When trying to exploit a vulnerability in your victim assets, you can choose three different attack types:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Web Server: try to exploit a vulnerability in the victim Web Server. The difficult is based on your Exploit Framework and the combination of your victim IPS and Web Server patch level. This attack is the most simple and the reward is 30% of the victim money;</li>
		<li>Application Server: try to exploit a vulnerability in the victim Application Server. The difficult is based on your Exploit Framework and the combination of your victim IPS and Application Server patch level. This attack has a medium difficult and the reward is 40% of the victim money;</li>
		<li>Database Server: try to exploit a vulnerability in the victim Database Server. The difficult is based on your Exploit Framework and the combination of your victim IPS and Database Server patch level. This attack is the most difficult, but the reward is 50% of the victim money!</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Based on your scanner ability, you can see the successfull percentage of each attack type and you can choose how to attack your victim.<br/>You have the choice to attack with an high successfull chance but low reward or a low successfull chance with an high reward, choose your strategy!</p>

	<p>When you decide how to attack that victim, just tap on the attack type of your choice.<br/>You will see the result of the attack, how much money and reputation you gained or lost and whether your attack was anonymous or not.</p>
	<img src="exploit_result.PNG" alt="Exploit Result" style="width:216px;">
	<p>Please note that you cannot attack the same target for an hour, even if the attack was unsuccessfull.</p>
	
	<h4>Maintaining Persistence with Malwares</h4>
	<p>In addition to exploiting systems, you can also use Malwares to attack the victim workstation instead of their assets.</p>
	<img src="exploit.PNG" alt="Exploit" style="width:216px;">
	<p>You can choose between three different malware attack types, one for an instant reward and other two for persistence on the victim workstation</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Money Malware: this type of malware immediately steals 45% money from the victim workstation, but without keeping persitence. The difficult is based on your Malware Framework and your victim Antivirus;</li>
		<li>Bot Malware: this type of malware is implanted on the victim machine and is persistent. This malware uses the victim workstation for different purpose and generate an hourly income based on your victim GPU. The difficult is based on your Malware Framework and your victim Antivirus, but the victim SIEM can detect the malware after some time</li>
		<li>RAT Malware: this type of malware is the most dangerous; after implanting it, you can see the status of your victim in realtime and attack it directly from the C&C Manager. In this way, you can monitor your victim and attack it at the right moment (when they have more money!). The difficult is based on your Malware Framework and your victim Antivirus, but the victim SIEM can detect the malware after some time</li>
	</ul>
	<p>When you decide how to attack that victim, just tap on the attack type of your choice (on the right of the target firewall). You will see the result of the attack and how much money and reputation you gained or lost.</p>

	<p>Please note that you cannot attack the same target with a Money Malware for an hour, even if the attack was unsuccessfull.
	<br/>You can try to implant Bot and RAT Malwares on your victim for a maximum of three times per hour.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Covering Tracks</h4>
	<p>The last phase of the attack involves covering your tracks to avoid the detection by your victim.
	<br/>This phase is done automatically for you by the use of a combination of proxies and TOR network that allows you to be anonymous.
	<br/>The chance of being anonymous is based on your Anonymizer level and the victim Firewall.</p>
	</details>	

	<details>
	<summary>C&amp;C Manager</summary>
	<p>In the C&amp;C Manager screen you can manage the Bot and RAT Malwares that you implanted on your victims.</p>
	<p>By implanting Bot Malwares you gain an hourly income based on your victim GPU.
	<br/>You receive half of the amount every half an hour.
	<br/>You can see the amount of money provided by each bot from this screen.</p>
	<img src="bot.PNG" alt="Bot Malwares" style="width:216px;">
	<p>You can implant a limited number of Bot Malwares based on your C&C Server level.<br/>If you want to remove one of the Bot implanted, you can click on it and tap the Remove button</p>
	<p>If the malware implanted is higher than the victim Antivirus, the victim cannot see the infection, although his SIEM can detect the infection after some time.</p>

	<summary>Missions</summary>
	<p>Another way to earn money is doing Missions! You receive missions based on your Mission Center level and GPU; the higher the level, the better the rewards!</p>
	<p>At the beginning of the game it's important to upgrade your GPU to increase missions rewards and earn money easily.</p>
	<p>With missions you also gain XP to level up and unlock new skills!</p>
	<p>You can sort your missions by Money, Time, XP and Status</p>
	<img src="missions.PNG" alt="Missions" style="width:216px;">
	<p>To start a mission, just click on the start button next to the mission that you want to start.
	<br/>The number of missions that you can run simultaneously depends on your Mission Center level.
	<br/>Each mission has a duration and a reward that you can collect when the mission is finished.</p>
	<img src="mission_running.PNG" alt="Mission Running" style="width:216px;">
	<p>When the mission is finished you can click on Collect button to retrieve your reward.</p>
	<img src="mission_finished.PNG" alt="Mission Finished" style="width:216px;">
	<p>When you finish every mission and collect all rewards, come back to the Mission Screen in order to receive new missions</p>
	<p>If you have spare money and you don't know how to spend them, a very good investment is to upgrade your Mission Center.
	<br/>It requires 100 Mission Center upgrades to reach a new Mission Center level, but with every new level you will get better missions with higher rewards and you will be able to run more missions at the same time</p>
	<img src="mission_center.PNG" alt="Mission Center" style="width:216px;">
	<p>When you reach Mission Center Level 5, you unlock the Collect All button in the Mission Center, that allows you to collect the rewards from all the finished missions at once.</p>

	<summary>Hacking Missions (Beta)</summary>
	<p>In the Hacking Missions you have to reach an objective by hacking a complex network with multiple hosts.</p>
	<p>Each scenario is randomly generated with one of the 25+ objectives, up to 12 hosts in 4 different networks, each one with a unique combination of services and vulnerabilities.
	<br/>Hack the network by scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities, using social engineering or bruteforce, escalating privileges and pivoting into the networks until you find your target!</p>
	<p>In the Hacking Missions overview you can see your mission objective that explain what is your final target and the action that you must perform on the target. 
	<br/>You have 48 hours to complete a mission and win 100 reputation points.</p>

	<p>In the datacenter screen you can see your crew datacenter and upgrade its offensive and defensive arsenal.
	<br/>Only Experts members or higher can upgrade the Datacenter.</p>
	<img src="my_datacenter.PNG" alt="Datacenter" style="height:216px;">
	<p>Your datacenter includes a Production and a Test Mainframe. Only the Prod Mainframe contains your Crew Wallet, but the attacker won't know which one is the right one!
	<br/>If you think that too many enemy crews have discovered your production mainframe, you can swap the two environments by reaching 50/50 on the Test label.</p>
	<p>Here is a brief description of each item:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>External Firewall: this is your first line of defense and the first item that an attacker must bypass, but also the easiest one;</li>
		<li>IPS: after bypassing the External Firewall, the attacker must evade your IPS that is a bit more difficult to attack;</li>
		<li>SIEM: it increases your chance of detecting incoming attacks to give you a chance to defend your datacenter;</li>
		<li>Internal Firewalls: you have two Internal Firewall to protect your Production and Test environments. The Internal Firewalls are more difficult to bypass;</li>
		<li>Mainframe: where your crew wallet is stored. Exploit the mainframe is the most difficult step of the attack!</li>
		<li>Your datacenter includes a Production and a Test Mainframe. Only the Prod Mainframe contains your Crew Wallet, but the attacker won't know which one is the right one!\nIf you think that too many enemy crews have discovered your production mainframe, you can swap the two environments by reaching 50/50 on the Test label.
		<li>Relocate: if you think that too many enemy crews have discovered your Datacenter location, you can relocate it in a new region after reaching 100/100 on the Relocate item.</li>
		<li>Anonymizer: allows you to remain anonymous while attacking other crew datacenters. If the attack is anonymous, it cannot be defended by the enemy crew.</li>
		<li>Scanner: allows you to see the current level of the enemy datacenter items and calculate the Success Chances and Anonymous Chances.</li>
		<li>Exploit Framework: this is the tool that your Crew uses to bypass the enemy firewalls, evade the IPS, disable the SIEM and hack the Mainframe!</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Upgrading an item consumes 1 point and you can use 2 points per hour and your Crew can use a total of 50 daily points.
	<br/>Points can be used for Upgrade, Defend and Attack, choose the best strategy with your crew members!.</p>
	
	<h4>Datacenter Relocation</h4>
	<p>When a crew is created, it is placed in a random region in the world. 
	<br/>At the beginning you can relocate it immediately, but after the first relocation you will need to reach 100/100 on the relocate item to perform another relocation.</p>
	<p>When you are ready to relocate your datacenter, tap on the Relocate button in the Datacenter screen and, from the world map, choose the new region where you want to relocate your crew datacenter.<p>
	<img src="datacenter_relocation.PNG" alt="Defend Datacenter" style="height:216px;">
	
	<h4>Defend Datacenter</h4>
	<p>In the Defend Datacenter screen you can view the status of the attacks in progress against your Crew Datacenter and defend from them.
	<br/>You can only see attacks that were not anonymous.</p>
	<img src="defend_datacenter.PNG" alt="Datacenter Relocation" style="height:216px;">
	<p>Next to each datacenter upgrade you can see it's current attack status.<br/>Tap on the item to remove all the detected attacks at that level. You can only see attacks that were not anonymous.
	<br/>NOTE: You can only remove the most advanced attacks. Example: if you have an attack in progress at your internal firewall, you must remove that before removing an attack from the IPS or External Firewall.</p>
	<p>Defending from attacks consumes 1 point and you can use 2 points per hour and your Crew can use a total of 50 daily points.
	<br/>Points can be used for Upgrade, Defend and Attack, choose the best strategy with your crew members!.</p>
	
	<h4>Crew Wars Map</h4>
	<p>In the Crew Wars Map you can scan the world regions to find other crews datacenters. Every crew member can scan a single region every hour.</p>
	<p>Tap on a region to see its details, including Region Name, Last Scan Time and Available Crews discovered during last scan.
	<br/>If the scan is still in progress, the region is highlighted in orange.</p>
	<img src="cw_map.PNG" alt="Crew Wars Map" style="height:216px;">
	<p>When a region is selected, you can Scan/Re-Scan it to detect new datacenters in that region.
	<br/>Use the Explore Region button to see the discovered datacenters of the selected region.
	<br/>Cooperate with your Crew members to routinely scan the world to find the latest and newly relocated datacenters!</p>

	<h4>Region Details</h4>
	<p>When you explore a region you can see the datacenters discovered during the last region scan in a random order.
	<br/>On the left table you can see the datacenter Name, Tag and difficult.
	<br/>The Difficult is based on the ratio between your datacenter upgrades and the target datacenter upgrades at the time of the scan.</p>
	<p>Tap on a datacenter to view its details including Datacenter Name, Tag, Wallet, Last Scan time, Last Attacked time and estimated Difficult.
	<br/>At the beginning all the details are hidden until you scan that specific datacenter.</p>
	<img src="cw_region.PNG" alt="Crew Wars Map" style="height:216px;">
	<p>Select a Datacenter and use the Scan/Re-Scan Datacenter button to reveal or update it's characteristics. Every crew member can scan a single datacenter per hour.</p>
	<p>After you have scanned a Datacenter, tap on Attack Datacenter to begin the attack!</p>
	
	<h4>Attack Datacenter</h4>
	<p>The Attack Datacenter screen allows you to view the current attack status against the target Datacenter and complete it. The deeper you go, the harder it gets!
	<br/>Next to each datacenter upgrade you can see it's current attack status.
	<br/>Tap on an item to view your Attack Chance and your Anonymous Chance. Tap again to proceed with the attack!
	<br/>TIP: if you disable the target SIEM, the Anonymous chance of the next attacks is 100%!
	<br/>NOTE: only the Production mainframe will give you the rewards (20% of the enemy Crew Wallet and Cryptocoins reward based on real difficult - this may differ from what you saw during the last scan).</p>
	<img src="cw_attack.PNG" alt="Crew Wars Map" style="height:216px;">
	<p>After your crew successfully exploited an enemy production mainframe, the same datacenter cannot be attacked until the next day.</p>
	<p>Attacking consumes 1 point and you can use 2 points per hour and your Crew can use a total of 50 daily points.
	<br/>Points can be used for Upgrade, Defend and Attack, choose the best strategy with your crew members!.</p>
